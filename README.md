# E-Commerce Node.js Project

This project is a simple eCommerce application built with Node.js and MongoDB Atlas.

## Project Structure

1. **Helper:**
   - Contains JWT (JSON Web Token) functionality.
   - Implements an error handler.

2. **Model:**
   - Includes models for product, user, order, and category.

3. **Routes:**
   - Product, user, order, and category routes.
   - Supports CRUD operations (GET, POST, GET:id, PUT, etc.).

4. **index.js:**
   - The main entry point of the application.

## Database Connection

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account.
2. Configure the database connection in the `.env` file.

## Packages Used

- `bcryptjs`: For password hashing.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
- `express`: Web application framework.
- `express-jwt`: Middleware for verifying JWT.
- `jsonwebtoken`: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- `morgan`: HTTP request logger middleware.
- `nodemon`: Development server for automatic restarts.
- `parser`: A parser package (please provide the correct package name).
- `prettier`: Code formatter.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the Node.js eCommerce project:

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Database Connection:**
   - Create an account on MongoDB Atlas (if not already done).
   - Configure the database connection in the `.env` file. Provide the necessary details such as `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`.

3. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
   - Run the following command to install all the required packages:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Run the Project:**
   - Once the installation is complete, start the project using the following command:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   This will launch your Node.js application. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.

5. **Testing with Postman:**
   - Open Postman or download it from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
   - Use Postman to test various API endpoints provided by your project.

### Additional Notes:

- **Development Mode with Nodemon:**
  - During development, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when changes are made. Use the following command instead:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- **Stopping the Server:**
  - To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where the server is running.

- **Customization:**
  - Customize the project according to your needs by modifying routes, models, and other components.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run your Node.js eCommerce project.
